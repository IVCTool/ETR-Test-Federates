# ETR-Test-Federates

Repository for test federates that support testing of compliance with aspects of the NATO FOM for Distributed Synthetic Training (aka. NETN FOM).
All federates will connect to an HLA RTI, e.g. Pitch pRTI or MÃ„K RTI, using the standard HLA IEEE 1516-2010 Java API. The RTI is not provided, contact vendors for commercial, evaluation or personal education/test licences. The RTI java libraries must be linked to compile and run the test federates.
